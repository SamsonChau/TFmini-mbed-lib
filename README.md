# TFmini-mbed-lib
A sample code and library using mbed os 6.xx to read the tfmini-s data on usart. Currently only allow serial read for the sensor, plan to add the setup and esxception handling to the code later.

# Test
tested on mbed os 6.13 with Nucleo F303K8 board with teh 5v uart version of tfmini-s
*for 5v UART version tfmini-s only, not tested on the i2c an d3.3v version yet*

# Update
